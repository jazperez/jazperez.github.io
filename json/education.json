Students learn to code through real-world projects in web development, apps, robotics, and video games. Each program is hosted by different tech companies, who offer guest speakers, workshops and a vast connection to female engineers and entrepreneurs. In addition, students go on field trips to different tech companies and develop a final project, in which students demonstrate their new skills on an issue they are passionate about."
